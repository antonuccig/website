I work at the [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE)](https://www.ccfe.ac.uk/), the UK's national laboratory for fusion research. I develop and analyse algorithms and software for the time-parallelisation of plasma physics simulations.

Other research interests include:
- Numerical solutions of differential equations,
- Scientific and high-performance computing,
- Mathematical modelling,
- Artificial intelligence,
- Data science.

## Industrial Collaborations

As a doctoral student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/industrially-focused-mathematical-modelling-epsrc-cdt), I worked alongside industries on problems arising in commercial settings. Collaborations of this kind are often fruitful for both the industrial partner, who benefits from reduced efforts and costs, and the mathematician, who is challenged with interesting research questions. Further details on past collaborations can be found [here](collaborations.html).
